# BLockBOTS
This repository hosts the project files for the BlockBOTS Project implemented at Make-A-Thon 4.0 organized and conducted by Lema Labs (IIT Madras Research Park) at Thought Works, Ascendas IT Park, Chennai.

BlockBOTS are re-configurable, re-programmable robots constructed using modular blocks that can be snapped together to form various configurations, leading to distinct functionalities.

BlockBOTS are intended to be used as educational kits for teaching robotics to kids, or as scientific toys, or even for research purposes!
