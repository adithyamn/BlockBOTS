# BlockBOTS
This repository hosts the project files for the BlockBOTS Project implemented at Make-A-Thon 4.0 organized and conducted by Lema Labs (IIT Madras Research Park) at Thought Works, Ascendas IT Park, Chennai.

BlockBOTS are re-configurable, re-programmable robots constructed using modular blocks that can be snapped together to form various configurations, leading to distinct functionalities.

BlockBOTS are intended to be used as educational kits for teaching robotics to kids, or as scientific toys, or even for research purposes!

Some blocks will have sensor modules in them, some will have actuators and some will have the processors (hierarchical controller configuration). The blocks, when connected properly, will form a functional robot depending on which blocks are used and how they are connected. Multiple configurations are possible depending on how the cubes are connected.

This project is practically inexhaustable and has an infinite scope for future development. A dedicated community may be established for further development of the project and to conduct educational and research programs involving industry as well as academia.
